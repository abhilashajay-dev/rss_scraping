Note:

This is toned-down version of the required Rss System, It  is configured for redis to run as message broker with celery as task manager. 
1. you can add the required rss url from sraping.py module
2. And Shedule Task from the admin since django-celery-beat is integrated in the system

username = admin
password = admin
